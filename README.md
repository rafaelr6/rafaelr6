# Rafael Rodriguez Rivera
I design and prototype agentic architectures and applications that bridge AI, payments, and tokenized ecosystems. My work focuses on building intelligent agents that operate across decentralized networks, financial APIs, and real-world data streams — with a strong emphasis on security, automation, and composability.

Most of what I build is hands-on: real code, tested patterns, and deployable frameworks for agent-based orchestration, programmable money, and crypto-native workflows. I explore how AI agents can reason, transact, and collaborate in tokenized environments — from smart wallets to autonomous payment flows

🎯 What I love to do 
-  Strategy & Architecture: modular design for scalable, composable systems
-  Agentic innovations: autonomous agents for key use case as payments , compliance, and crypto operations
-  Payments SME: driven flows across fiat, crypto, and tokenized assets as other current payments rais cards, instant payments
-  Tokenized Workflows: smart contract integration, on-chain/off-chain coordination
-  Crypto-native: chat-based wallets, agent wallets, and decentralized identity
-  Ready-to-run stacks: clone → configure → deploy on cloud or local nodes
