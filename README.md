# Rafael Rodriguez Rivera
I design and prototype agentic architectures that bridge AI, payments, and tokenized ecosystems. My work focuses on building intelligent agents that operate across decentralized networks, financial APIs, and real-world data streams — with a strong emphasis on security, automation, and composability.

Most of what I build is hands-on: real code, tested patterns, and deployable frameworks for agent-based orchestration, programmable money, and crypto-native workflows. I explore how AI agents can reason, transact, and collaborate in tokenized environments — from smart wallets to autonomous payment flows

🔍 What I work on
- 📊 Strategy & Architecture: modular design for scalable, composable agent systems
- 🧠 Agentic Infrastructure: autonomous agents for key use case as payments , compliance, and crypto operations
- 💸 Programmable Payments: AI-driven flows across fiat, crypto, and tokenized assets
- 🧾 Tokenized Workflows: smart contract integration, on-chain/off-chain coordination
- 🪙 Crypto-native: chat-based wallets, agent wallets, and decentralized identity
- 📦 Ready-to-run stacks: clone → configure → deploy on cloud or local nodes
